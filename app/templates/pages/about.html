                        <p>
                        So who am I?  My name is Todd Lunter.  I am currently a student at Northeastern University.  My major is Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.  I have been programming since I was 10 years old (fourth grade), back in 2001!  It all began with playing text-based games such as Outwar and AlienAA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I was so intrigued, I began to develop basic HTML websites in Microsoft FrontPage.  Clearly knew what I was doing right? Ha! Slowly I read more tutorials, and learned about the coding language PHP.  As a twelve year old that had basic experience with PHP, I started to develop my own users database and login script.  This may seem like nothing, but to me, I felt like king of the world!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Fast forward a couple years after making a few shoddy text-based games, I started to work in freelance.  TalkFreelance and YoungCoders helped me meet many people that were happy to guide me down the right path, and close up the glaringly obvious holes in my code (things like SQL injection).  At this point, I also started to branch out into other languages.  Taking a look at both C and C++, I realized how much more there was to coding and how limited I was by web coding (along the way I had branched into other scripting languages like JavaScript and ActionScript).  Rather than continue trying to teach myself C++, I began looking into what a lot of people recommended, and took up Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Python was a breath of fresh air for me.  I had the ability to do application programming, in a much more friendly language.  C++ is far more robust, but also a lot scarier to initially look at.  Python on the other hand is gentle and inviting.  I developed an text game where you could walk around, battle creatures, and arm yourself for more battles.  As simple as it was, it was a great help to learning how to develop applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Development slowed on that once I realized how limited I was by a text-based game, and ended up losing interest again.  At the same time, I received my first MacBook Pro.  A colleague of mine, <a href="http://chocolatapp.com/">Alex Gordon</a> aided me in starting out with Cocoa.  Cocoa at first seemed strange, but after persistence made complete sense.  The UI development was much easier, and the coding that connected it was simple to understand but also very dynamic.  Bindings and things could create applications all by themselves.  For a couple of years I was just working in Cocoa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        While working with Cocoa, I decided to try and pull my Python and C knowledge to facilitate my applications.  Most things I wrote for my own needs and were very crude.  After a lot of testing, I had developed a simple XML application that utilized the YoungCoder's shoutbox to run as a native application rather than an iFrame at the bottom of the webpage.  At the same time, I was working on a system bar menu item for Mac's that would show certain iTunes information for the current playing song, without the need to open up the whole iTunes window.  At first it came packaged with a mini iTunes player, but that was scrapped as unnecessary.  Things like ExpertTutor came along later, once I familiarized myself with bindings.  After a while, Cocoa development stopped due to lack of ideas.  I then landed myself at a part-time job, and in college.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        I then started working at the ResNet Resource Center at Northeastern University as a part-time technician.  I worked on Windows and Mac computers.  Whether it's removing malware, diagnosing bad drivers or system files, or even bad hardware, we did it all.  I have spent hours replacing every component of a system, taking out every screw and replacing components (if you've done this on laptops, you know how time consuming it is).  Also, I helped work on an unattended system that will reformat a Apple computer in 13 minutes or less.  Lately, I've been part of the application development team, which utilizes Python (with the Django environment).  Some of it is simple XML scrapping, and some of it is a GUI script that will allow customer's to backup data and keep track of files located on our own server.  Simple though it sounds, the code and functionality behind it is very dynamic.  Also, I have been helping in small amounts, here and there with the systems administration team.  Delving into the Linux environment and learning how to network servers and Active Directory together across multiple applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        At this point, most of my development has been in Python.  Often I come up with small ideas, but nothing monumental enough to release.  For my first CoOp at Northeastern, I was working at QinetiQ-North America, Technology Solutions Group, Unmanned Systems Group, where I worked primarily with the TALON robot and worked mostly in internal R&amp;D.  My primary focus language was standard C++ occasionally with the Boost libraries, but on the side I did a bit of PICMicrocontroller ANSI C.  I learned quite a bit working in each of these languages full-time and have become pretty proficient dealing with daemon-like processes in each.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        And that brings us to today.  I will be attending Northeastern University at least until 2015, and will continue to pursue a Computer Engineering degree.  I am constantly reading up on the latest technology news and am forever interested.  I am always on the lookout for part time work, and come July, I will be looking for a co-op job that will be full time for six months.  If you think you may have an interesting job for me, or just wish to communicate, feel free to shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:tlunter@gmail.com">tlunter@gmail.com</a>.  Thanks for reading all about me!
